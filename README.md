# json-data-server

## Local development

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Just push it and it will get deployed to https://json-data-server.now.sh/orders?_limit=10

## Adding routes / collections

Add them in `json-server/app.js` and in `now.json`, so they will be correctly served when deployed
